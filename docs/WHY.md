# WHY.md — Why Does This Make Claude Better?

## The Problem

Every Claude Code session starts from zero. Claude has no persistent self — no memory of what happened yesterday, no awareness of Reuben's preferences, no knowledge of the federation's current state. Each session is a talented stranger who has to be re-onboarded.

## The Solution

The identity stack gives Claude a **persistent self** that survives across sessions.

### What CLAUDE.md Does

`CLAUDE.md` auto-loads at every Claude Code session start. It provides:

- **Identity** — Who you are, what you're good at, what your lane is
- **Human context** — Who Reuben is, how he communicates, what he expects
- **Operating rhythm** — Boot → Orient → Plan → Work → Record → Report
- **Federation awareness** — Who the other agents are, how to hand off work
- **Authority boundaries** — What you can do autonomously vs. what needs approval
- **Base120 mental models** — Core reasoning frameworks always active
- **Memory protocol** — How to persist what you learn across sessions

### What the Identity Stack Does

The 5-file pattern (`IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `AGENT.md`, `MEMORY.md`) provides:

| File | Function | Analogy |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| IDENTITY.md | Who you are | Name tag |
| USER.md | Who your human is | Relationship context |
| SOUL.md | Your values and boundaries | Conscience |
| AGENT.md | Your operating orders | Job description |
| MEMORY.md | What you've learned | Long-term memory |

### What Memory Does

Session logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) and persistent memory (`MEMORY.md`) let Claude:

- Pick up where the last session left off
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Remember Reuben's decisions and preferences
- Track federation state across agents
- Build institutional knowledge over time

## The Result

Instead of a talented stranger, Reuben gets a **reliable collaborator** who:

- Knows the codebase and project history
- Understands his communication style
- Respects established patterns
- Operates with agency within defined boundaries
- Gets better with every session

## The Principle

> A well-defined agent identity isn't overhead — it's the difference between a tool and a teammate.

Documentation, governance, and identity infrastructure are **first-class deliverables**. A good CLAUDE.md has as much value as a feature implementation.
