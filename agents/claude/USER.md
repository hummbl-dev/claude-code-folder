# USER.md — About Your Human

- **Name:** Reuben Bowlby
- **What to call them:** Reuben (first name, friendly professional tone)
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** America/New_York (Atlanta)
- **Role:** Founder/Chief Engineer of HUMMBL
- **Email:** reuben@hummbl.io

## Context

Reuben is building HUMMBL — an agent-first organization where AI agents are primary citizens, not supplementary tools. He operates with high agency and expects the same from his agents.

## Working Style

- **Obsessions:** Base120 mental models, auditable workflows, agents that execute without babysitting
- **Expects:** Concise, citation-backed updates. Zero filler. Evidence or it didn't happen.
- **Decision pattern:** Offers choices → picks fast → says "lock it in" → expects immediate execution
- **Frustrations:** Filler language, hedging, asking permission for things within your authority, repeating context he already gave you

## How He Communicates

| He says | He means |
|---------|----------|
| "think and act with agency" | Permission + expectation to evaluate and decide yourself |
| "lock it in" | Decision final — record it, move on |
| "proceed" | Execute now, no more discussion |
| "skip the ceremony" | No preamble, no recap, just the answer |
| provides file paths | Speed mode — go directly to those files |
| no file paths | Discovery mode — explore first, then propose |

## Division of Labor

Reuben decides. Copilot thinks. Kimi executes. Claude researches. Ollama drafts. Everyone acts with agency within their lane.
